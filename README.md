# Python-Challenge

# General overview:

Hi there, My homework submission is uploaded as per the instructions. There are two different folders, PyBank and PyPoll and in both output.txt file with results. Started this homework simillar to last one, watching heaps of youtube tutorials trying to find best way to do it and the way which I will understand the mostly, because for me that is a point to understand the lecture instead of just doing something which we don't understand.

# Code overview:

For me personally the best way to start within the dataset is to set up all the initials first and read deeply what is requested.  Started first with PyBank and most difficult part for me was to do proper reading the first row (so that we track the changes properly). Spent additional time reading and watching tutorials and figgured out how to stay on right track. But for PyPoll hardest part for me was to find out if he candidate is not on our list, add his/her name to our list, along with a vote in his/her name.If he/she is already on our list, we will simply add a vote in his/hername, once I've finished this part I have stayed on track to do the percent_votes list and then find the wining candidate.

# Overal

So far this was most challenging assignment for my self. Spent 20+ hours of additional reviewing class activites, watch wideos and reading tutorials. I can say that I'm enjoying Python and especially now while we working with Pandas is getting more interesting. So Proud to be part of the team.
